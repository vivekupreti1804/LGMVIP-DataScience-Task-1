(A) Iris Flowers Classification ML Project

About Project This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning.
The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms,
mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

Technology Used 1.Python 2.Jupyter Notebook 3.Numpy Library 4.Pandas Library 5.Some Part of Sklearn Library

Result Following Accuracy We get:-
1.By Using Support Vector Classifier - 94.73 %
2.By Using Decision Tree Classifier - 94.73 %
3.By Using K Neighbors Classifier (KNN) - 97.36 % ( Best One )
